please convert this into a single javascript file in such a way that there isn't circular dependencies.
keep the output verbatim as the original.

in your thought only, do the following:
1. what is the order of the files?
2. what line ranges are imports for each file? 
3. what line ranges is the file content besides imports for each file? (i.e lib/astar.js is from 1 to 130)
4. do we need to re-order the files to solve dependencies? think about it a bit here.
5. what is the new order of files in the new single file?
6. what line ranges do they correspond to in my numbering??
7. what is the final ordering 


give it to me in a way that I could expand and run it using jexpand, see how to do it in the end of the prompt


{{include_folder("/Users/ohadr/Auto-Craft-Bot/mineflayer-pathfinder/lib", line_numbers="short")}}


<file path='index.js'>
{{include_file("/Users/ohadr/Auto-Craft-Bot/mineflayer-pathfinder/index.js") | line_numbers}}
</file>



<jexpand>
{{include_file("/Users/ohadr/jexpand/JEXPAND.md") }}
</jexpand>
